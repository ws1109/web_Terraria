            <h1>Forest</h1>
            <p>Forests comprise the majority of the surface world and are typically where the player initially spawns. The general landscape of a forest includes lots of grass, plenty of trees, several lakes ranging in size from small to large, occasional hills that can reveal cave entrances, and often times contain a Living Wood Tree. Mushrooms, Sunflowers, Daybloom, Strange Plants, and several dye plants can be commonly found strewn throughout this biome. During the Halloween season, Pumpkins can commonly be found growing in this biome. There is a small chance for low tier ores to spawn on the surface in a forest. The various types of ores that can be found consist of copper or tin, lead or iron, and sometimes tungsten or silver.</p>

            <h1>Snow biome</h1>
            <p>The Snow biome, also known as the Tundra, is a biome that takes on an arctic theme, being primarily composed of Snow and Ice Blocks, and displaying a constant snowfall effect. Trees within Snow biomes have a snowy cover on them, and yield Boreal Wood instead of ordinary Wood. During rain, a Snow biome will undergo a blizzard instead, where snowfall increases, causing decreased visibility, and unique enemies to be able to spawn. Some NPCs will sell different items when situated in a Snow biome, including the Merchant, Painter, and Clothier.</p>

            <h1>Ice biome</h1>
            <p>The Ice biome, also known as the Underground Tundra or Underground Snow biome, is a biome that is the underground version of the Snow biome, starting at the Cavern layer and stopping at the lava layer. On the 3DS version version, the Ice biome starts at the Underground layer. It is composed mainly of Snow Blocks and Ice Blocks. Thin Ice can be found generated over water and breaks when a character falls over 4 tiles onto it (unless using the Ice Skates or another accessory crafted from them). The Ice biome is the only place where Ice Chests can be found naturally.In Hardmode, the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow can spread through it, generating Purple, Red, and Pink Ice Blocks respectively. They are unable to spread through Snow Blocks.</p>

            <h1>Underground</h1>
            <p>The Underground is the first layer below the surface. It fills the area between the Surface and Cavern layers, beginning at a depth of 0ft and extending downward.The Underground can be recognized by its distinctive background, which no longer contains naturally-placed Dirt Walls like surface terrain, but instead displays a unique backdrop with no naturally-placed walls. Players cannot remove this backdrop using a Hammer, nor can they place blocks in midair, as no wall generally exists here (though players can place their own walls, just as they can above surface terrain). Natural Underground blocks are generally similar to those in the surface.The Underground is home to more aggressive enemies than the surface, as well as traps, Chests, and Underground Cabins.</p>

            <p>The Cavern layer is the largest layer, beginning just below the Underground and extending all the way down until the Underworld layer. It is characterized by darker stone background tiles. Stone is the predominant block in this layer (as opposed to Dirt in the Underground). Caverns contain occasional Underground Cabins where valuables can be found, as well as Glowing Mushroom biomes, dangerous traps, rare and dangerous Spider Cave mini-biomes, and much more.Lava begins to appear around -2100ft in small pools, which gradually become lava wells at around the -3000ft mark.</p>

            <p>A Glowing Mushroom biome, also known as Glowing Mushroom Fields, is a biome characterized by Mushroom Grass and Glowing Mushrooms growing on Mud Blocks. Giant Glowing Mushrooms can grow to significant heights if room is allowed for them to grow, and will regenerate if chopped down. Most elements of a Glowing Mushroom biome emit a faint glow, including its Mushrooms, Grass, and Giant Glowing Mushrooms, along with some of its enemies. The Truffle NPC requires a house in a Surface (above-ground) Glowing Mushroom biome.</p>

            <p>The Corruption is an evil biome with a dark purple wasteland, death, and decay theme, in contrast to the red gore theme of its counterpart, The Crimson.

Both contain similar hazards and feature their own unique enemies, items, and blocks. The tools, weapons, and armor obtained via Corruption materials are generally faster, but slightly less powerful than those obtained via Crimson materials. Corruption enemies tend to have slightly lower stats, such as health, defense, and damage.</p>

Being at such high altitude, players often experience reduced gravity when navigating them. Both are similar in size and placement, and both rest atop Cloud and Rain Cloud blocks with background Cloud Walls.</p>
